    "By looking at the visualization, we can see that Music does not take the highest percentage within the total catagory. We see that Entertainment was the biggest slice within the pie chart. In almost every country, Entertainment is over 50 percent of the total video category. One explanation is that Entertainment videos are those which have diverse content (instead of being dependent on one topic), which is why they can reach a bigger range of audience. Beside Entertainment, we can see several other popular categories for each country. For example, in Spain, we see a trend in Music and People/Blogs. In France, we have Comedy and News/Politics. In Great Britain, we have Gamming and Music. In the US, it spreads evenly within Style, Music, People and Comedy. "
